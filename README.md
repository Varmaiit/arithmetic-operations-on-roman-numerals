# arithmetic-operations-on-roman-numerals
Python code which can perform arithmetic operations on Roman Numerals

## How to use run this file
1. Clone this repository into your local 
1. This program needs Python 2.7 (Install Python 2.7 if not installed)
1. In case you dont know which version of python installed in your local use ```python -V``` command
1. Make sure that your PWD(Present working Directory) is the cloned repository in your terminal if not go to the cloned folder
1. Run ```python roman_arithmetic.py``` in your terminal from this working directory
1. Enter the roman arithetic operation which you want to perform in this below format
    1. You need to enter RomanNumber1 <Space> Operation <Space> RomanNumber2 (**Eg: XL + X **)
1. You will get result also you would get Unittest status below the Result:

## The following is the result when I have run the program on my loccal

``` Please enter RomanNumber1 operation RomanNumber2 seperated by spaces (Eg: XL + X ) XL + X
Result: XL + X = L
Also printing Unit test Results
